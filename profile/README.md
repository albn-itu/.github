### Some practical stuff
#### Naming scheme
I'm naming my repositories using the naming scheme `{Course}-{Project}(-{Number})`

- `Course` is a 4-6 letter code assigned to the course, see table below.
- `Project` is just a name given to the project, such as exercises, attacklab, handin, etc.
- `Number` is only present if there is more than 1 assignment with that name, in that case it's a 2 digit number.

**Examples**
```
bosc-attacklab
bdsa-assignment-01
bsec1-handin-2
```

#### Even more work 
Most of the projects here have been worked on with multiple other people. The collaborators are all invited and listed on the repository. 

As is the nature of group work, work is shared, some of that is creating the repository. So i do not own all of the repositories, therefore i have listed the ones i have participated on, but which is not contained in this organization.

Some of the projects have been created on a ITU's hosted version of GitHub, for some of the projects, i have copied them over to here, and given credit to the other authors of the project. In the list below these projects are marked with :recycle:.

Some projects i cannot access, or am not allowed to share/copy, these are marked with :lock:.
